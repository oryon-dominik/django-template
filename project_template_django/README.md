# {{ project_name }}

Generated by 'django-admin startproject'.

Project dependencies are managed by [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
Realised as a django project.  


## Setup & developing

- [How-to-clone-and-ssh](./documentation/how-to-clone-and-ssh.md).
- [How-to-develop basics](./documentation/how-to-develop.md).
- [jupyter notebooks for fast debugging](./documentation/notebooks.md).


### Install dependencies

    # either install all requirements
    poetry install

    # cherry pick the ones you need
    poetry install --with authentication,restframework,vite --without postgres,paragons

    # or install only the root dependencies (updating the lock file)
    poetry install --only-root --sync


### Setup the project

    poetry run python commands.py setup
    poetry run python manage.py migrate


### Pre-Commit hooks

[Pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks) are defined
in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Adding them to the project will ensure that the
code is formatted and linted before committing.  

    poetry run pre-commit install


### Tests

Run [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).

    poetry run pytest


### Linter

Lint with [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) and [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8).

    poetry run ruff check .
    poetry run flake8


### Formatter

Autoformatting is enforced with industry-standard [black](https://github.com/psf/black).

    poetry run black --check .


### Type checker

Static type checking can be checked with [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/).

    poetry run mypy --config-file pyproject.toml .


### gitflow

Following the blog-post from [Vincent Driessen: A successful git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) we are using our own naming conventions: `develop` -> `trunk`, `master` -> `production` to orient a bit more on apaches [svn-branching model](https://subversion.apache.org/quick-start) and [the modern github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Starting a new release should usally be followed up by a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). Hint: use [hub](https://hub.github.com/) to add them from CLI.  

To start a new feature, use `git flow feature start <name>`.  
To finish a feature, use `git flow feature finish <name>`.  

`git flow init` shall produce the following entries in `.git/config` following our naming conventions.

    [gitflow "branch"]
        master = production
        develop = trunk
    [gitflow "prefix"]
        feature = feature/
        bugfix = bugfix/
        release = release/
        hotfix = hotfix/
        support = support/
        versiontag =


### postgresql via docker

- [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [postgres image on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

You might want to use the postgres docker container inside `compose/postgres.yml`  
Be aware that no other (local) postgres shall be running on the same port (`5432`), otherwise docker is known to introduce some hard to find conflicts - especially on windows machines using *wsl* as the hypervisor.  

Build and run

    docker compose -f compose/postgres.yml build
    docker compose -f compose/postgres.yml up

Bash-shell to container

    docker exec -it postgres /bin/bash

Edit `pg_hba.conf`

    apt-get update && apt install -y vim && vim /var/lib/postgresql/data/pg_hba.conf

DB-shell

    # linux
    docker compose run postgres psql -h localhost -U developer -d {{ project_name }}
    # windows
    docker compose run postgres psql -h host.docker.internal -U developer -d {{ project_name }}
